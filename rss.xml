            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Detroit-based drone expert: Package delivery, transporting people may be on horizon</h1><p>For some, drones are toys. But for others, they serve a much more important purpose. Detroit Aircraft Corp CEO and founder Jon Rimanelli doesn't see drones as a hobby -- to him, they are a tool. "They actually improve the quality of life for people by doing the jobs that are dirty, dull and dangerous, and ultimately save time, lives and money," he said.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/240da3c6b30bac3b2c55c48fbf825be7b21b5e83.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Watch a parachute rescue a drone in free fall</h1><p>The technology isn't perfect; a drone won't fall any more slowly than 9.8 feet per second, so the odds are that it'll still take damage. However, the parachute could mean the difference between a total loss and recovering camera footage, and could give bystanders more time to get out of the way.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f736fc4e3627a10c6ee4bba673050186aac35977.jpg"></article>]]></description>
